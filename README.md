# Multiple Disease Prediction App

This project is a Streamlit-based web application that predicts the likelihood of multiple diseases using pre-trained machine learning models. The app currently supports predictions for:

- **Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)**
- **Liver Disease**
- **Parkinson's Disease**
